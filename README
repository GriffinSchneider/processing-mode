Processing mode for Emacs.
Written by Rudolf Olah.

== About & Usage ==

This mode is a derivative of the java-mode. It adds key-bindings for
running/compiling Processing sketches and it also highlights keywords
found in the Processing language, such as ``setup'', ``draw'', and
``frameRate''.

The key-bindings are:

    C-c C-b    Preprocess, and compile a sketch into .class files.
    C-c C-r    Preprocess, compile, and run a sketch.
    C-c C-p    Preprocess, compile, and run a sketch full screen.

The mode also includes helpful code snippets. To use them you must
install the YASnippet package found here:

== Bugs ==

* Compilation...there is a bug in the compilation because the
  Commander class of Processing does not accept the ``--preferences''
  option. The workaround is to copy your ``preferences.txt'' from your
  home directory (in Linux it can be found in ``~/.processing/'') to
  the sketch directory. You will have to create a sub-directory called
  ``lib'' in the sketch directory which is where the
  ``preferences.txt'' file will reside. Sym-linking also works.

* Compilation errors...The regular expression used to detect
  compilation error messages does indeed work. Unfortunately there is
  another regular expression that is interfering and being matched
  _before_ it.
