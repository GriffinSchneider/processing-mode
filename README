Processing mode for Emacs.
Written by Rudolf Olah.

This mode is a derivative of the java-mode. It adds key-bindings for
running/compiling Processing sketches and it also highlights keywords
found in the Processing language, such as ``setup'', ``draw'', and
``frameRate''.

The key-bindings are:

    C-c C-b    Preprocess, and compile a sketch into .class files.
    C-c C-r    Preprocess, compile, and run a sketch.
    C-c C-p    Preprocess, compile, and run a sketch full screen.

The mode also includes helpful code snippets. To use them you must
install the YASnippet package found here:
